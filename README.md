# Code for master's thesis
In this file, we will briefly describe at which points of the thesis we use the attached Matlab and R codes.
## Matlab code
The attached Matlab code helps us to compute an explicit formula for the asymptotic variance of $\sqrt{n} (\hat{\beta}_n - \beta)$. This formula computes as a vector-matrix-vector multiplication of the matrix $\Sigma$ and the gradient $\nabla \varphi(v)$. The attached Matlab code applies this multiplication.
## R code
We attach different R files to our thesis. We will briefly describe them in the following.
### code_functions.R
### code_applications.R
